Version 0.8.1 *(2015-08-28)*
----------------------------

* Fix: Setting the topbar to invisible didn't correctly resize the view
* Change: Made `DayViewFacade` non final for unit test mocking

Version 0.8.0 *(2015-08-21)*
----------------------------

* Change: The view now responds better to layout parameters.
The functionality is similar to how `adjustViewBounds` works with ImageView,
where the view will try and take up as much space as necessary,
but we base it on tile size instead of an aspect ratio.
The exception being that if a `tileSize` is set,
that will override everything and set the view to that size.
* Fix: Use more efficent method for indexing months
