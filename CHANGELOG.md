Change Log
==========
Version 1.4.4 *(2017-06-30)*
----------------------------
* New: Added `mcv_topbarBackground` to apply a custom background drawable for topbar
* Fix: Fixed issue in `showOtherDates` when applying combined flags `out_of_range|decorated_disabled`

Version 1.4.3 *(2017-02-21)*
----------------------------
* New: Added set click listener method for title
* New: Added `setSaveCurrentPosition` builder method to use the current position when switching mode
* Fix: Fixed title update when only year changed
* Fix: Fixed decorator rendering with custom tile dimensions on API Level 21
* Fix: Added missing `dynamicHeightEnabled` save in `onSaveInstanceState()`
* Fix: If we used `match_parent` for the MaterialCalendarView but the size available is not enough, the view was truncated

Version 1.4.2 *(2016-10-10)*
----------------------------
* New: match_parent is now supported by tileSize, tileWidth and tileHeight
* New: api for title animation orientation horizontal/vertical `setTitleAnimationOrientation`
* Fix: Issue with custom arrow mask being overwritten when set in xml
* Fix: Issue when clicking date outside of current year would trigger the wrong goToNext or goToPrevious method
* Fix: WeekDayFormatter would overwritten first day of the week

Version 1.4.0 *(2016-06-01)*
----------------------------
* New: Add select range functionality. Use `setSelectionMode(MaterialCalendarView.SELECTION_MODE_RANGE)` and `setOnRangeSelectedListener`
* Breaking Change: `setFirstDayOfWeek`, `setMin/MaxDate`, and `setCalendarDisplayMode` are moved to a `State` object. Call `mcv.state().edit()` to edit them and commit the changes with `commit`. See [CUSTOMIZATION_BUILDER](docs/CUSTOMIZATION_BUILDER.md) for usage details.
* Change: Updated documentation regarding 1.3.0 additions
* Fix: Current month and title pager updates correctly if minDate is set after the current month
* Fix: Week number difference calculation correctly accounts for DST offsets. Thanks Igor Levaja!
* Fix: Date formatter uses L instead of M for month (standalone instead of context sensitive)

Version 1.3.0 *(2016-05-16)*
----------------------------

* New: MCV `goToNext` and `goToPrevious` API to programmatically trigger paging
* New: Allow users to click on dates outside of current month with `setAllowClickDaysOutsideCurrentMonth`
* New: Set tile width/height separately rather than single tile size
* New: Attributes: mcv_tileWidth, mcv_tileHeight, mcv_calendarMode
* Change: `CalendarMode.WEEK` officially marked `@Experimental`, use with caution
* Change: `getTileSize` is deprecated, use `getTileWidth` and `getTileHeight`. `setTileSize` still works as a convenience method to set width and height at the same time.
* Fix: Issue with arrow not enabled when setting maxDate
* Fix: Issue with number of pages not calculated correctly with maxDate causing last page to be unreachable
* Fix: TalkBack content descriptions for pager view, forward/back arrows, and ability to set them manually
* Fix: Crash while in Week mode when `CalendarPagerAdapter#getItemPosition` is called
* Fix: Calendar Mode is retained on restore instance state
* Fix: Min/Max date range is retained on restore instance state
* Issue: Week mode - Restore instance state shows the previous week of the one that was saved
* Issue: Week mode - Some combinations of first day of week, min/max date can cause the last week not to be pagable

Version 1.2.1 *(2016-05-05)*

Version 1.0.1 *(2015-09-30)*
----------------------------

* Fix [#143](https://github.com/prolificinteractive/material-calendarview/issues/143):

Version 0.8.1 *(2015-08-28)*
----------------------------

* Fix: Setting the topbar to invisible didn't correctly resize the view
* Change: Made `DayViewFacade` non final for unit test mocking

Version 0.8.0 *(2015-08-21)*
----------------------------

* Change: The view now responds better to layout parameters.
The functionality is similar to how `adjustViewBounds` works with ImageView,
where the view will try and take up as much space as necessary,
but we base it on tile size instead of an aspect ratio.
The exception being that if a `tileSize` is set,
that will override everything and set the view to that size.
* Fix: Use more efficient method for indexing months

----------------------------
