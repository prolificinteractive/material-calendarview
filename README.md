Material Calendar View [![Android Arsenal](https://img.shields.io/badge/Android%20Arsenal-Material%20Calendar%20View-blue.svg?style=flat)](https://android-arsenal.com/details/1/1531)
======================

A Material design back port of Android's CalendarView. The goal is to have a Material look
and feel, rather than 100% parity with the platform's implementation.

Usage
-----

1. Add `compile 'com.prolificinteractive:material-calendarview:1.1.0'` to your dependencies.
2. Add `MaterialCalendarView` into your layouts or view hierarchy.
3. Set a `OnDateSelectedListener` or call `MaterialCalendarView.getSelectedDates()` when you need it.

[Javadoc Available Here](http://prolificinteractive.github.io/material-calendarview/)

Example:

```xml
<com.prolificinteractive.materialcalendarview.MaterialCalendarView
    android:id="@+id/calendarView"
    android:layout_width="match_parent"
    android:layout_height="wrap_content"
    xmlns:app="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res-auto"
    app:mcv_showOtherDates="all"
    app:mcv_selectionColor="#00F"
    />
```

Major Change in 1.0.0
---------------------

With the implementation of multiple selection, some of the apis needed to change to support it,
namely `OnDateChangedListener` is now `OnDateSelectedListener`. There are also a bunch of new apis
for multiple selection.

Also, `showOtherDates` is now a set of flags for finer control over which extra dates are shown.

Major Change in 0.8.0
---------------------

The view now responds better to layout parameters.
The functionality is similar to how `adjustViewBounds` works with ImageView,
where the view will try and take up as much space as necessary,
but we base it on tile size instead of an aspect ratio.
The exception being that if a `tileSize` is set,
that will override everything and set the view to that size.

Customization
-------------

One of the aims of this library is to be customizable. The many options include:

* [Define the view's width and height in terms of tile size](docs/CUSTOMIZATION.md#tile-size)
* [Single or Multiple date selection, or disabling selection entirely](docs/CUSTOMIZATION.md#date-selection)
* [Showing dates from other months or those out of range](docs/CUSTOMIZATION.md#showing-other-dates)
* [Setting the first day of the week](docs/CUSTOMIZATION.md#first-day-of-the-week)
* [Show only a range of dates](docs/CUSTOMIZATION.md#date-ranges)
* [Customize the top bar](docs/CUSTOMIZATION.md#topbar-options)
* [Custom labels for the header, weekdays, or individual days](docs/CUSTOMIZATION.md#custom-labels)

More Customization
------------------

This fork of the library adds the following additional customizations:

* Customize text appearance of selected date using `setSelectedDateTextAppearance` or XML attribute `mcv_selectedDateTextAppearance`
* Customize text appearance of dates from other months using `setUnfocusedDateTextAppearance` or XML attribute `mcv_unfocusedDateTextAppearance`
* Enable vertical swiping to page to next/previous month by calling `setVerticalSwiping`
* Show or hide header arrows with `showArrows`
* Set selected date background drawable shape using `setSelectedDrawableShape` with `DrawableShape.CIRCLE` or `DrawableShape.RECTANGLE`

### Events, Highlighting, Custom Selectors, and More!

All of this and more can be done via the decorator api. Please check out the [decorator documentation](docs/DECORATORS.md).

### Custom Selectors and Colors

If you provide custom drawables or colors, you'll want to make sure they respond to state.
Check out the [documentation for custom states](docs/CUSTOM_SELECTORS.md).
