Material Calendar View
======================

A Material design back port of Android's CalendarView. The goal is to have a Material look
and feel, rather than 100% parity with the platform's implementation.

Breaking Change in FUTURE *(RELEASE_DATE)*
------------------------------------------

* Change: The view now responds better to layout parameters.
The functionality is similar to how `adjustViewBounds` works with ImageView,
where the view will try and take up as much space as necessary,
but we base it on tile size instead of an aspect ratio.
The exception being that if a `tileSize` is set,
that will override everything and set the view to that size.

Usage
-----

1. Add `compile 'com.prolificinteractive:material-calendarview:0.7.0'` to your dependencies.
2. Add `MaterialCalendarView` into your layouts or view hierarchy.
3. Set a `OnDateChangedListener` or call `MaterialCalendarView.getSelectedDate()` when you need it.

Customization
-------------

One of the aims of this library is to be customizable.

Options available in Java and as XML attributes:

| Attribute             | Type      | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
|:----------------------|:----------|:----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| showOtherDates        | boolean   | By default, only days of one month are shown. If this is set `true`,then days from the previous and next months are used to fill the empty space.This also controls showing dates outside of the min-max range. |
| arrowColor            | color     | Set the color of the arrows used to page the calendar. Black by default.                                                                                                                                        |
| selectionColor        | color     | Set the color of the date selector. By default this is the color set by`?android:attr/colorAccent` on 5.0+ or `?attr/colorAccent` from the AppCompat library.                                                   |
| headerTextAppearance  | style     | Override the text appearance of the month-year indicator at the top.                                                                                                                                            |
| weekDayTextAppearance | style     | Override the text appearance of the week day indicators.                                                                                                                                                        |
| dateTextAppearance    | style     | Override the text appearance of the dates.                                                                                                                                                                      |
| weekDayLabels         | array     | Supply custom labels for the days of the week. This sets an `ArrayWeekDayFormatter` on the `CalendarView`.The default uses Java's `Calendar` class to get a `SHORT` display name.                               |
| monthLabels           | array     | Supply custom labels for the months of the year. This sets a `MonthArrayTitleFormatter` on the `CalendarView`.The default implementation formats using `SimpleDateFormat` with a `"MMMM yyyy"` format.          |
| tileSize              | dimension | Set a custom size for each tile. Each day of the calendar is 1 tile, and the top bar is 1 tile high.The entire widget is 7 tiles by 8 tiles. The default tile size is `44dp`.                                   |
| firstDayOfWeek        | enum      | Set the first day of the month                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| leftArrowMask         | drawable  | Supply a different drawable mask for the left arrow                                                                                                                                                             |
| rightArrowMask        | drawable  | Supply a different drawable mask for the right arrow                                                                                                                                                            |

|:-------------------|:----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| setMinimumDate()   | Set the earliest visible date on the calendar                               |

### DayViewDecorator

Decorators allow you to change several aspects of each day's appearance.
To do so, you need to make a new instance of `DayViewDecorator` and add it to the calendar with `addDecorator()`.
Decorating is done via a `DayViewFacade` that is passed to the `decorate()` method.
All calls to the `DayViewFacade` will be applied to every day `shouldDecorate()` returns true.

`DayViewFacade` has three methods to allow decoration:

1. `setBackgroundDrawable()` set a drawable to draw behind everything else. This also responds to state changes.
2. `setSelectionDrawable()` allows customizes the selection indicator for specific days.
3. `addSpan()` sets a span on the entire day label.
    * `DotSpan` was added to show a dot centered below the label
    * For an introduction to spans, see [this article](http://androidcocktail.blogspot.com/2014/03/android-spannablestring-example.html).
    * If you want to learn more about custom spans, check out [this article](http://flavienlaurent.com/blog/2014/01/31/spans/).
4. `setDaysDisabled()` allows you to disable and re-enable days. This will not affect minimum and maximum dates.

If one of your decorators changes after it's been added to the calendar view, make sure you call `MaterialCalendarView.invalidateDecorators()` to have those changes reflected.

When implementing a `DayViewDecorator`, make sure that they are as efficent as possible.
Remember that `shouldDecorate()` needs to be called 42 times for each month view.
An easy way to be more efficent is to convert your data to `CalendarDay`s outside of `shouldDecorate()`.
